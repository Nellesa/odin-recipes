In this project I mainly got used to using Git commands:

git add name-of-the-file

git commit -m "Subject line of the change" 
-keep it simple and descriptive, under 50 char, start capital, don't end with period, use imperative mood, seperate subject and body with a blank line, body should answer what, why and how-

git push origin main

git status

git log -use "q" to quit-

Furthermore, it is vital to use the file system properly to stack the files.

Lastly, we can use "ol" or "ul" to stage links -or anchor tags-.
