    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>To make a delicious lasagna, you'll need lasagna noodles, ground beef or Italian sausage, 
        diced onions, minced garlic, marinara sauce, ricotta cheese, mozzarella cheese, 
        Parmesan cheese, eggs, and a mix of Italian herbs like basil and oregano. 
        Start by browning the meat with onions and garlic, then add the marinara sauce and 
        season with herbs. In a separate bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, eggs, and some Parmesan. 
        Begin layering in a baking dish: sauce, noodles, ricotta mixture, mozzarella, and repeat. 
        Finish with a generous layer of mozzarella and Parmesan on top. 
        Bake in the oven until it's bubbly and golden brown. Let it cool for a few minutes, 
        slice, and serve up a hearty, cheesy, and satisfying lasagna!
