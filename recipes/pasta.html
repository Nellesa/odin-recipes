        Italian pasta is a staple of Italian cuisine, known for its simplicity and delicious flavors. 
        The most basic Italian pasta dish involves cooking pasta until it's al dente and then tossing 
        it with a flavorful sauce. Common pasta types include spaghetti, fettuccine, penne, or any pasta
         of your choice. The sauce can vary from a simple tomato and basil sauce to more complex options 
        like carbonara or Alfredo. Italian pasta is all 
        about balancing the flavors of the sauce with the texture of perfectly cooked pasta.
